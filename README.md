# Color Lines
Another copy of the famous game written in C++ with SFML.

## Rules
* Move balls from cell to cell, group balls of the same color horizontally, vertically, and diagonally;
* The more balls are combined, the more scores you earn;
* Each move drops 3 new balls if you do not make a line of 5 balls;
* Keep moving and combining balls as long as you can.

## Controls
* Select a ball, then select a cell which a non-diagonal path exists to;
* Click at the top panel to start a new game;
* When the game is over, click anywhere to start a new game.

## License
* No license.
* I doubt that somebody will ever find this code.

## Credits
* Sprites have been made by me.
* Font has been taken from here: https://github.com/s-a/digital-numbers-font.
